## Robotics Challenge

The challenge consists of a guide on ROS (Robotics operating system) that engineers of Kiwi Campus Inc have done with a lot of detail, there you will have to solve step by step simulations, programming tasks and deployment of environments (packages) to complete the challenge, you can find theoretical questions in different points, as well as tests to know your ability using ROS.
